Wk1 diary
  Progress so far;
    1. We have selected Su Ann as our Scrum Master as she was doing her internship in Atlassian, and we all agreed on her skills on using the Jira.
    2. Jira Project have been created by Su and the rest of us has been invited to the group.
    3. The weekly meeting has been set on Friday 2pm, but I realise it is just 1 day after lab, may not be very useful, so I'll mention this issue of rescheduling the weekly meeting time.
    4. A new group member joined during the weekend, and our tutor has been informed.
    5. The topic we chose are Recipe Recommendation System.

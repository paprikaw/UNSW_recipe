Week 2 Diary
Progress this week:
  1. Agreement has been made for changing the weekly meeting time from Friday 2pm to Monday 8:30pm.
  2. During Monday meeting, we assigned each person a specific functionality and ask them to provide a drafting user story so we can finalise them for proposal in Thursday meeting.
  3. We came up with multiple novel functionalities, but as for some of them, we were not sure about its uniqueness, so we consulted our tutor Sooriea and got some feadbacks.
  4. During Thursday meeting, user stores for default requirements has been finalised, but the user story for novel features was forgtten and we decided to hold a another quick stand-up meeting on Saturday night.
  5. And in order to finish the proposal report, we've assigned each person to investigate certain area so that we can finish them early in wk3.

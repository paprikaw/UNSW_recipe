**Week 2 Diary**
_Progress this week_:
  1. Agreement has been made for changing the weekly meeting time from Friday 2pm to Monday 8:30pm.
  2. During Monday meeting, we assigned each person a specific functionality and ask them to provide a drafting user story so we can finalise them for proposal in Thursday meeting.
  3. We came up with multiple novel functionalities, but as for some of them, we were not sure about its uniqueness, so we consulted our tutor Sooriea and got some feadbacks.
  4. During Thursday meeting, user stores for default requirements has been finalised, but the user story for novel features was forgtten and we decided to hold a another quick stand-up meeting on Saturday night.
  5. And in order to finish the proposal report, we've assigned each person to investigate certain area so that we can finish them early in wk3.

**Wk3 Diary**
_Progress this week_:
  1. On Monday night, we further discussed the user stories and integrated them in one file, as the draft idea for the proposal.
  2. Su Ann created a frame work for proposal on the same date, so we could add our own part into it.
  3. Based on the feedback from the tutor, we adjusted our expectation for the novel features from "food of the week" to "food of the moment", as the fromer one would be much harder to demonstrate its validity during the marking session.
  4. And during Thurdsday lab time, we initially agreed to finish everything by that time, however, due to delay from UI and flow diagram, we put our own deadline of proposal backward from Friday to Saturday. 
  5. On Saturday morning, Qing and I had a long discussion and finished the UI and flow design. Formatting was also done in the same day afternoon.
  6. Xu and Tian also uploaded their demo on frontend as a starter code so that we can all play with.

**Wk4 Diary**
_Progress this week_:
  1. During weekly Monday meeting, we tried the starter code developed by Xu Bai (Eric). Since he did his dev on Mac, we identified plenty of compatibility isuues and urged him to work on given VM instead. 
  2. On the following day, Eric and Tian fixed the above issue by setting up an automaiton script which helped to build the essential dependencies.
  3. Qing / Tian / Eric were working on Frontend, Su Ann and I was investigating db schemas and configuring cloud storage. And we agreed to demonstrate each one's work on lab time.
  4. I finished the signin route, tested the code and created a merge request. During the dev, I noticed that Su Ann implemented a simpler version of return format, which raised my concern as it is not consistent between different return scenarios. I soon opened an issue in Github and notified both Su Ann and the frontend team. After a thorough investigation, we made an agreement to keep up with my return value structure. It may be a bit complicated. But it won't crash in case of an unwanted access to a non-existing field.
  5. In Thursday lab, we further disgussed our workflow and all agreed to work in two teams, frontend and backend, in this way, we won't mess up our work flow in our general channel in Teams.
  6. Other Team members progress: Su Ann created the schema of our database and implemented the signup route & reset route for testeing purpose. Eric, Qing and Tian finished their implementation on Sign in / Sign up. All of their works were in track and overall impressive. 

**Wk5 Diary**
_Progress this week_:
  1. I suggested to be aware of the automatically expiring the users' session, as we didn't handle it in both backend and frontend. Su Ann purposed that it was way to complex for this stage and we should focus more on the recipe stuff. I did agree. I'd gone a bit off track from the original purpose. XD
  2. Finished the accounts part in the backend. Should be ready for demo in wk5 lab.
  3. Planned what to do in flex week.
  4. Demonstrated how the sprint1 went in wk5 presentation
  5. Conducted retro will all team members right after the demo

**Wk6 Diary**
_Progress this week_:
  1. Discussed the payload format that is necessary for sprint 2.
  2. Investigagted the tech feasibility of uploading local image and storing it on web hosted services.
**Wk6 Diary**
_Progress this week_:
  1. After the argument of whether to use local storage or web-hosted image storage, we made our decision to keep on using local storage for storing thumbnails.
  2. As mentioned above, I started to implemente the backend contributor route. However, I found out as the flask request only handle one object at a time, i.e., one pic or one json object. Hence, I realieased it is not possible to finish the contributor within one route. So I had a quick meeting with the frontend team and split the uploading recipe into two workflow. First, create the recipe using a thumbnail first, then backend will return the recipeId and then frontend will pass remaining infomation like recipe name to the backend.
  3. Implementd the recipe contributor route in backend, all tested.
